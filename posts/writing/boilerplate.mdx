title: Boilerplate

I've been using Github Copilot, and I've been enjoying it. When I'm writing most code, it does _okay_, but doesn't really help too much yet. But every once in awhile it shines. 

For things that are of less importance to me, it really does well. Testing is one of those topics. It is good at adding a lot of boilerplate copy.

Seeing this bafflegap reminds me of the war memorandum by Winston Churchill in 1940 concerning brevity. There is a lot to be said for it, but unlike ink or computer memory, brevity is in short supply.

Copilot is great for writing tests. But tests consist of boilerplate, as does infrastructure-as-a-service and other tasks. As AIs expand, I expect to see more content writen by AIs for the sake of SEO in the blog spave. Copy that is writen by no one, and read by few for the sake of ranking on automated search engines. And non-production code that becomes so vast that no human will want to read it unless they have to "fix a thing".

This could get interesting.
