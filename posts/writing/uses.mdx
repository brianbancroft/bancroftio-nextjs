## What do I use?

When considering software tooling, I try to use open-source, well-maintained tools whenever possible. I take a different approach with hardware.

## Hardware

- 14" Macbook pro with a magic trackpad and keyboard
- Logi 1080p webcam on an inexpensive light stand. 

## Shell

- hyper.js with cobalt2 theme and summon
  - Font: `fontFamily: 'MesloLGS NF, Menlo, "DejaVu Sans Mono", Consolas, "Lucida Console", monospace',`

- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- powerlevel10k

## Code Editors

- VSCode 
- Vim (this is still useful for work on servers where latency isn't the best)

### VSCode Extensions

 - Better Comments
 - Better TOML
 - Add jsdocs comments
 - eslint/prettier/css formatter
 - direnv 
 - docker
 - erb formatter/beautify
 - ES7 + React/Redux/React-Native Snippets
 - Gitlens
 - Synthwave 84 Theme


### Vim Extensions

- Pathogen
- Nerd Tree
- Vim ColourSchemes

## Git

- I use the command line git tools mainly. Sometimes, I use the Git extension in VSCode along with Gitlens for Git Blame. 

## Language Version Management

- asdf-vm

## Design

- Affinity Designer/Paint
- Heropatterns
- Heroicons
- Undraw Illustrations


## Music 

- Spotify
- Camillo Accordion
- Raycon sport earbuds

## Camping

- Danner boots
- Kelty Backpacks in general. They do well
- MSR Whisperlite Campstove
- GSI Cookset
