# Simple React App


[Live site](https://connect-three-plus-one.netlify.app/)

This is a simple game of connect four. 

## UI and Codebase

[Repo](https://github.com/brianbancroft/connect-one-more-than-three)

This is a hasty app that uses Vite's React framework, using Tailwind's CSS utility classes.

The UI is hosted on Netlify.

App has some tests using RTL over Vitest, which seems to be an appropriate name for that framework.
